# sketcher_py
This script accepts image path as input and outputs a sketched image in the same path as original image.  
> C:\<filepath>\img.jpg as input  
> C:\<filepath>\img_sketched.jpg as output  

After testing, turns out the sketcher loses details in high quality photos. It now resizes to a width of 720, maintaining the same aspect ratio.
